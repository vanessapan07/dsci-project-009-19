    "2. Weird outliers. The top 6 highest hours ranges from 53 to 223 hours. These outliers heavily affect the skewedness and thus the data's use in prediction. \n",
    "3. Quick scroll through and there are a lot of 0 hours in there. Even spotted a supposed Veteran with 0 hours of playtime (103)\n",
    "4. Much of the data here appears to be self-reported, which will result in bias and misrepresentation as everyone's definition of each of the 5 classifications would inevitably be different, unless a very specific metric was provided for that specific question. As for the players' ages, they could lie about it and nobody would know unless the survey asked for direct identification. So there is high uncertainty for the reliability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues: First, the variance in the data is extremely high, which indicates that the data is inconsistent, making it lose power in prediction. Though you can't really expect consistency in people's gaming times. I suppose this suggests that time spent won't be a good variable to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, 681, 1019 no end time. Different time formats, ie ddmmyyyyhhmm and unix. The unix's scientific notation is jarring and unreadable for humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, here's no clear indicator of what constitues a session. Like, someone could just be leaving the game open without doing anything on it and it'd constitue as a session. I think this poses as a big issue if we want to use players with a large playtime as a predictor, as it could indicate both engagement and forgetfulness, the latter being detrimental to any analysis regarding the target audience. Forgetful players probably won't even notice that you are targetting them in recuiting efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, some users have an insane amount of sessions. But I feel the exact \"insanity\" should be dependent on how long the observation period was held for. For example, if the observation period only consisted of 10 days, 310 sessions would most likely indicate bot activity, regardless of how long each session lasts. But if it was over 4 years (I doubt it), 310 is very, very casual, human even; it averages out to around 1.5 sessions per week. So bot activity is very hard to find here, and it also poses as an obstacle to finding the target audience, because a person with 310 sessions could range from 217 sessions per week to 1.5 depending on the observation period, making it indiscernable whether they are active players, casual players, or bots. In other words, the session count is effectively meaningless without time bounds.\n",
    "could be one off as well, like maybe a player played for hours on end for a couple months and lost interest rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this dataset, the session amount and time are the only possible predictors for the question posed. So given the multiple drawbacks of this dataset, I highly doubt it would be used much in the model.\n",
